TODOs:
Display data on all students in 1 advisory/MS/GCYC-member/etc
    --> start w/ just student IDs and whether or not they're on track --> help user identify which students to focus on individually
Expand excel scrape to cover eoy_dashboard.xlsx
Make it possible to upload new Excel file

Ideas:
Get rid of filters & show all individual data
Get rid of empty values in graphs
